      <h3>Intelligent Home Automation and Energy Management using IoT</h3>
      <p><em>October 2024 - March 2025 | Major Project</em></p>
      <p>Working on the Smart Home Automation and Energy Management System was a collaborative journey that blended innovation, technical depth, and hands-on learning. As a team, our goal was to design a system that not only automated household appliances but also prioritized energy efficiency using renewable energy sources. We integrated a range of sensors — including temperature, motion, light intensity (LDR), and water level sensors — with an Arduino Mega, which served as the central controller. Each sensor played a critical role in making real-time decisions, such as turning on the air conditioner at night when the temperature dropped, activating lights based on ambient lighting, or pumping water when tank levels were low. One of the standout features was our intelligent power management system. By combining a solar panel setup with a UPS and grid integration, we created a smart switching mechanism that prioritized solar energy whenever available, falling back on the grid only when necessary. We also used a PZEM module to monitor energy consumption, helping us fine-tune power usage and reduce grid dependency. For remote control and monitoring, we connected our system to the Blynk IoT platform via an ESP32, allowing users to manage appliances from anywhere using a smartphone. This project offered a full-cycle engineering experience — from circuit design and embedded programming to IoT integration and system testing. It was not only technically challenging but also immensely satisfying to see everything come together into a functional, scalable smart home solution. The experience underscored the power of teamwork, innovation, and the role of technology in building sustainable, intelligent living spaces.</p>

      <h3>Luggage Security Alarm using NAND Gates</h3>
      <p><em>October 2022 - February 2023 | Course Project</em></p>
      <p>The Luggage Security Alarm project was one of our earliest explorations into digital logic design, and it proved to be both intellectually stimulating and practically rewarding. As a team, we set out to create a simple yet effective security solution using nothing but NAND gates — showcasing how basic components, when combined with smart logic, can deliver real-world functionality. Our system was designed to trigger an alarm if someone attempted to tamper with or move a piece of luggage, making it particularly useful in public transport areas, airports, or crowded events. The challenge lay in translating a real-life security scenario into a pure hardware logic system — no microcontrollers, no coding, just Boolean logic and circuit design. We utilized sensors to detect movement and lid openings, which then fed into our custom-designed logic circuit. The alarm would activate only under specific, unauthorized conditions, helping reduce false triggers and making the system reliable. Through this project, we deepened our understanding of combinational logic, truth tables, and circuit optimization. It also highlighted the value of simplicity in design — proving that effective solutions don’t always require complex systems. Most importantly, it fostered teamwork, problem-solving, and a deeper appreciation for the foundational concepts that underpin modern electronics.</p>

      <h3>Simple Clap Switch</h3>
      <p><em>June 2022 - August 2022 | Course Project</em></p>
      <p>The Simple Clap Switch project was a fun and hands-on introduction to the world of sound-based automation. As a team, we set out to build a device that could turn appliances on or off with just a clap — no remote, no switches, just sound. Using a basic microphone module, an amplifier, and a 555 timer IC, we were able to detect the sound frequency of a clap and convert it into a digital signal. This signal then activated a relay that controlled the appliance. The project offered insights into audio signal processing, filtering unwanted noise, and basic relay switching. Despite its simplicity, the project sparked a lot of interest, and it became clear that sound can be a practical input for smart systems. The project was particularly enjoyable as it blended theory with practical implementation and helped build our confidence in electronics design.</p>
